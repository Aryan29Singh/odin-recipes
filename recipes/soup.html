    <img src = "soup.jpg">
    
    <p>Youâ€™ve never tasted a soup quite like this one before! This light and refreshing dish has a peppery bite from radishes, hot sauce, and chile powder that is balanced out by creamy avocados, tangy whole buttermilk, and a little honey for sweetness. </p>
    

    <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces radishes, trimmed, divided</l1>
        <li>13 ripe avocados, divided</l1>
